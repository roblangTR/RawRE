## AUDIO RECOMMENDATIONS

### Split Edit Locations:
1. **Mayor to Council Debate**: Picture leads sound
   - Cut picture at 0:18, sound at 0:19
   - Creates L-cut for smooth transition

2. **Council to Protesters**: Sound leads picture
   - Fade up protest ambient 1 second before cut
   - Creates J-cut, anticipates location change

### Ambience Tracks Needed:
- City traffic (under development site)
- Council chamber room tone (continuous under chamber shots)
- Crowd protest sounds (under protester shots)
- General exterior ambience (under reporter stand-up)

### Audio Levels:
- Keep ambient at -20db to -18db
- Mayor dialogue at -12db to -6db  
- Reporter at -10db to -8db
- Fade transitions: 0.5-1 second duration
