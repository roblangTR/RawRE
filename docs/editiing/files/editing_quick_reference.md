# VIDEO EDITING QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
## Based on "Grammar of the Edit"

## SHOT TYPES
```
XCU/ECU → Detail (eye, hand, object detail)
BCU     → Face fills frame
CU      → Head shot
MCU     → Chest up
MS      → Waist up
MLS     → Knees up
LS/WS   → Full body + environment
VLS     → Subject small in frame
XLS/ELS → Maximum environment
2-SHOT  → Two subjects
OTS     → Over-the-shoulder view
```

## THE 6 ELEMENTS OF A GOOD EDIT
```
□ INFORMATION  → New visual/audio data?
□ MOTIVATION   → Why cut NOW?
□ COMPOSITION  → Frames different enough?
□ CAMERA ANGLE → 30°+ change?
□ CONTINUITY   → Movement/position/sound match?
□ SOUND        → Audio supports transition?
```
**4-6 elements = Strong edit | 2-3 = Weak | 0-1 = Avoid**

## TRANSITION TYPES

**CUT** (Use 90% of time)
- Continuous action
- Real-time events  
- Should be invisible

**DISSOLVE** (Time/emotion)
- Passage of time
- Location changes
- Emotional moments
- Duration = 1-3+ seconds

**WIPE** (Rare)
- Graphic transitions
- Major location jumps
- Fast & fun

**FADE** (Chapter markers)
- IN: Begin scene/show
- OUT: End scene/show

## 180-DEGREE RULE (ACTION LINE)
```
      CAMERA SIDE
    ╱─────────────╲
   ╱               ╲
  A ←────────────→ B
   ╲               ╱
    ╲─────────────╱
     DON'T CROSS!
```
**Stay on one side or subjects flip positions**

## EDIT CATEGORIES

**ACTION EDIT**
- Cut on movement
- Continuity is key
- Overlap action

**SCREEN POSITION EDIT**  
- Frame left → Frame right
- Leads viewer's eye
- Classic dialogue

**FORM EDIT**
- Match shapes/sounds
- Usually dissolve
- Time compression

**CONCEPT EDIT**
- Unrelated shots
- Create meaning
- Juxtaposition

**COMBINED EDIT**
- Multiple types at once
- Most sophisticated

## SPLIT EDITS (L-CUTS/J-CUTS)

**Sound Leading Picture**
```
AUDIO:  ────Shot A────────Shot B────
VIDEO:  ─────Shot A──────────Shot B─
                      ↑ Cut here
```

**Picture Leading Sound**
```
AUDIO:  ─────Shot A──────────Shot B─
VIDEO:  ────Shot A────────Shot B────
                      ↑ Cut here
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Jump cuts (insufficient angle change)
❌ Crossing the 180-degree line
❌ Mismatched head room
❌ Objects "growing" from heads
❌ Inconsistent audio perspective
❌ Cutting mid-word in dialogue
❌ Removing actor pauses
❌ Partial faces at frame edge

## DIALOGUE EDITING CHECKLIST

□ Respect 180-degree rule
□ Match eyelines
□ Use reaction shots
□ Maintain look room
□ Keep actor pauses
□ Match audio levels
□ Continuous ambience
□ Complete thoughts in bites

## NEWS EDITING PRIORITIES

1. Factual accuracy
2. Temporal accuracy  
3. Speaker intent
4. Clear information
5. Appropriate pacing
6. Professional sound

**News = Mostly CUTS, minimal dissolves**

## SHOT DURATION RULE

Speak the shot description aloud:
- "House in hills, smoke from chimney, man walking, sun setting"
- When description done → Cut

## THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **Sound & Vision are Partners** - Audio supports picture
2. **New Shot = New Information** - Always advance story
3. **Every Edit Has a Reason** - Know why you're cutting
4. **Observe the Action Line** - Maintain spatial relationships
5. **Right Transition Type** - Cut > Dissolve > Wipe for most work
6. **Good Edits are Invisible** - Serve the story, not the ego

## DECISION TREE
```
Can I cut here?
  ├─ Does it provide new info? → YES → Continue
  ├─ Is there motivation? → YES → Continue
  ├─ Sufficient angle change? → YES → Continue
  ├─ Continuity maintained? → YES → Continue
  ├─ Compositions different? → YES → Continue
  └─ Sound works? → YES → CUT!

If more than 2 NOs → Reconsider edit
```

## WHEN STUCK

1. Review the 6 elements
2. Check continuity
3. Try different in/out points
4. Consider split edit
5. Look for natural breaks
6. Trust your gut on timing
