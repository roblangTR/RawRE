In the foreground, a priest in a black stole and a military officer in a tan uniform are carefully lowering a small, rectangular, metallic casket into a freshly dug grave. Another military officer, seen from behind, is already in the grave, assisting with the placement. In the background, rows of small, house-shaped grave markers and manicured green bushes extend into the distance, with a tall, white monument visible further back. Several other individuals, some in civilian clothes and some in military uniforms, observe the ceremony from a distance. The scene is brightly lit by natural sunlight.",
